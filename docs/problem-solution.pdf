AI Resume Analyzer - Problem & Solution Draft

Problem:
Manual resume screening is slow, subjective and error-prone. Students and recruiters struggle to quickly identify strengths, gaps and job fit.

Solution:
An AI Agent that:
- Ingests a resume PDF
- Uses Gemini to generate a structured understanding of the candidate
- Computes skill gaps vs target roles
- Recommends next learning steps and suitable roles
- Exposes this via a simple API + web dashboard

(Replace this file with your final nicely formatted PDF before submission.)
